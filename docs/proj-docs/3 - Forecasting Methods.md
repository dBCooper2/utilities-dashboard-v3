# Forecasting Methods for Weather Data

For the Weather element of the dashboard, we will need a day-ahead forecast of the weather, ideally in the 15-minute resolution. We will also need a weekly forecast of the weather to get a look at the week ahead and make rough estimates of energy usage, that are refined as the days go on. These forecasts will be done by me and then compared using visualizations against actual forecasts that I will pull from an API (still TBD on where that will come from).

If I want to start working on some introductory forecasting techniques for the weather data I have collected, what techniques should I use for forecasting the day-ahead data and a weekly forecast? Add this information to my forecasting methods markdown file, listing any sources you used
```

### Answer

Given that our data needs to be forecasted to predict day-ahead prices for utilities across the SE USA, we need robust forecasting techniques for both short-term (day-ahead) and medium-term (weekly) weather predictions. Weather conditions significantly impact utility demand and pricing, making accurate forecasts essential for operational planning.

#### 1. Day-Ahead Forecasting Techniques

For day-ahead weather forecasting, the following methods are recommended:

##### 1.1 Statistical Methods

- **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)**: 
  - Well-suited for short-term forecasts (24-48 hours)
  - Excellent for capturing temporal dependencies in weather data
  - Can be enhanced with exogenous variables (ARIMAX) for improved accuracy
  - Implementation available via `pmdarima` Python package with `auto_arima` for parameter optimization

##### 1.2 Machine Learning Methods

- **Prophet**:
  - Developed by Facebook, handles seasonality and holiday effects well
  - Decomposable time series model with trend, seasonal, and holiday components
  - User-friendly and requires minimal parameter tuning
  - Great for temperature and humidity forecasting with strong daily patterns

- **Gradient Boosting Models** (XGBoost, LightGBM):
  - Excellent for incorporating multiple weather variables
  - Can handle non-linear relationships in the data
  - Able to capture complex patterns that statistical models might miss

##### 1.3 Ensemble Approaches

- **Combining Multiple Models**:
  - Average predictions from multiple model types (statistical + ML)
  - Weighted ensemble based on historical performance of each model
  - Can provide more robust forecasts than any single model

#### 2. Weekly Forecasting Techniques

For weekly forecasts (3-7 days ahead), the following methods are recommended:

##### 2.1 Deep Learning Approaches

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks**:
  - Capable of learning long-term dependencies in weather patterns
  - Particularly effective for multi-step forecasting
  - Can process multiple input features and capture complex temporal relationships
  - Example implementation using Keras/TensorFlow

- **Seq2Seq Models**:
  - Encoder-decoder architecture for multi-step predictions
  - Better performance for longer sequence forecasting than traditional time series models

##### 2.2 Advanced Statistical Methods

- **SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)**:
  - Extends ARIMA to handle seasonal patterns in weather data
  - Appropriate for weekly cycles in temperature, precipitation, etc.

- **Vector Autoregression (VAR)**:
  - Models relationships between multiple time series simultaneously
  - Useful for capturing interdependencies between weather variables

##### 2.3 Hybrid Models

- **Neural Hybrid Models**:
  - Combining statistical methods (ARIMA) with neural networks
  - Leverages strengths of both approaches

#### 3. Implementation Strategy

Our implementation approach will follow these steps:

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Handle missing values through interpolation
   - Create lagged features (previous 24h, 48h, 72h values)
   - Incorporate temporal features (hour of day, day of week)

2. **Model Selection**:
   - For day-ahead: Start with ARIMA and Prophet as baseline models
   - For weekly: Implement LSTM as primary model with SARIMA as a benchmark

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) for overall accuracy
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error) for interpretability
   - Specialized metrics for specific weather variables (e.g., mean directional accuracy for wind)

4. **Ensemble Strategy**:
   - Weighted averaging of predictions based on historical performance
   - Dynamic weighting that adjusts based on recent model performance
   - Separate ensembles for different time horizons (24h, 48h, 72h, 1 week)

#### 4. Special Considerations for Weather Variables

Different weather variables require specialized approaches:

- **Temperature**:
  - Strong diurnal and seasonal patterns → Prophet or SARIMA
  - Relatively smooth changes → Linear methods work well
  
- **Precipitation**:
  - Zero-inflated data → Two-stage models (classification then regression)
  - High variability → Ensemble methods
  
- **Wind Direction**:
  - Circular data → Specialized circular statistics
  - Vector decomposition approaches

- **Wind Speed**:
  - Often follows Weibull distribution → Transform before modeling
  - Gradient boosting models typically perform well
